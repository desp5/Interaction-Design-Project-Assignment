# Introduction

# Summary


# 1st Deliverable
1. Design brief :
     We are going to design a system that takes sound as input and outputs a                  pattern of lights according to the amplitude of the input. 
2. Research (PACT) :
     i.Analyse People : People that want to decorate their house, streamers and for party      luxuries. <br />
     ii.Define Activities : Partying or just talk to each other casually. <br />
     iii.Describe Context : Partying or just talk to each other casually. <br />
     iv.Review needed technology : Arduino, breadboard, sound sensor, led RGB and other        devices that may come in handy later on the project. <br />

 3. Information architecrture :
     We are going to desing a sound reactive system. Making use of RGB led lights and a        sound sensor to control the light intensity based on a sound input. <br />
 4. User interaction : <br />
     Interaction between user and system will be achieved through sound picked up by the      sound sensor, either by music or talking. The goal is to make entertain the user          by providing a visual feedback to accompany music or a conversation in an indoor          setting. <br />
 5. Interface design :  <br />
     Interface components:  
      -Arduino - to connect the components together and act as the brain of the system.   <br />
      -RGB led - to react to sound. <br />
      -Sound sensor - to pick up sound from the enviroment. <br />
      -Cables - to connect the components together. <br />
      -Resistors - to prevent the led from burning. <br />
    We have the sound sernsor which will take music and sound intensity as input and         the RGB led lights as output. To be more precise we are thinking to put a                 scale on the led lights starting from blue colour (min sound sensor) and ending at       red (max sound sensor) and when there is no sound for the sensor the lights are           turned off.
